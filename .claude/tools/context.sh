# context.sh — what this .claude config costs you in context, every session.
#
# Why: config is not free. A rule in .claude/rules/ with no `paths:` frontmatter
# loads into EVERY session, forever, whether or not it is relevant. This repo
# shipped 11 such rules using Cursor's `globs:`/`alwaysApply:` fields — which
# Claude Code does not read — so all 22,018 bytes of them loaded on every
# session, including the Go and REST rules on a Python project. Nothing
# reported that, because nothing measured it.
#
# What loads when (the model this tool encodes):
#   ALWAYS  rules/*.md with no `paths:`         — full text, every session
#   ALWAYS  the description: of every skill,    — the listing Claude matches
#           command and workflow                  intent against
#   LAZY    rules/*.md with `paths:`            — only when a matching file is touched
#   LAZY    a skill/command/workflow body       — only when invoked
#   LAZY    an agent definition                 — only in that agent's own context
#
# So the lever is: keep always-on text short, put everything else behind
# `paths:` or an invocation. Pair with the bundled /skill-doctor, which reports
# which loaded skills actually went unused.
#
# Usage: context.sh [--summary] [--refresh]
# Exit: always 0 — this is a report, not a gate.
